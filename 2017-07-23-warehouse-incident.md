**JULY 2017, PAHANG, MALAYSIA** - The royal Malaysian police was met with an absolutely bizzare case early in the morning, at 8:36 A.M. when they received reports of a newly destroyed warehouse in Pahang, and that multiple bodies were discovered at the aforementioned location. When the police arrived, they counted a total of 30 dead bodies scattered around the ruins of the warehouse.

> "There were evident signs of an intense shootout in the warehouse, as seen by the various bullet holes in what remains of the walls", - lead investigator Mahmed bin Faidah. 

Evidence has also been discovered that points to the warehouse housing terrorist activity in the past.

> "I believe that the explosion and the firefight was a result of possibly an internal skirmish between the terrorists" - Detective Taamir bin Maisara

The investigation is still currently ongoing.
